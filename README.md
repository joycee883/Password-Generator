# 🛡️ Project Spotlight: Password Generator & Simple Tkinter App 🛡️

### 📋 Project Overview: 

This project involves the development of two separate Python applications using the Tkinter library. The first part is a Password Generator, which creates strong, random passwords based on user-defined lengths. The second part is a Simple Tkinter App, demonstrating basic GUI functionality by changing a label's text when a button is clicked.

### 🛠️ Tools Used:

Programming Language: Python <br>
Libraries:<br>

Tkinter: For creating graphical user interfaces.<br>
random and string: For generating random passwords.<br>
pyperclip: For copying passwords to the clipboard.<br>

### 🔍 Key Steps

### Password Generator:

UI Setup: Initialize the Tkinter window and configure its size and title.<br>
Password Length Input: Add a Spinbox for users to specify the desired password length.<br>
Password Generation: Ensure at least one character from each type (uppercase, lowercase, digits, punctuation) and fill the rest with random characters.<br>
Password Display: Show the generated password in an Entry widget.<br>
Clipboard Functionality: Allow users to copy the generated password to their clipboard.<br>

### Simple Tkinter App:

UI Setup: Initialize the Tkinter window and configure its title.<br>
Label Creation: Add a label widget with a default text.<br>
Button Interaction: Create a button that changes the label's text when clicked.<br>

### 📊 Key Findings:

The Password Generator effectively creates secure, random passwords meeting user-defined criteria.<br>
The Simple Tkinter App demonstrates basic GUI interaction and event handling in Tkinter.<br>

### 🏁 Conclusion:

This project showcases the versatility of Python and Tkinter in building both functional and interactive applications. The Password Generator provides a useful tool for enhancing security, while the Simple Tkinter App serves as a foundational example for GUI development in Python.

### 🌐 Application:

These tools can be applied to various scenarios requiring secure password creation and basic graphical user interface interactions, providing practical solutions for everyday tasks.
