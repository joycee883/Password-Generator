# PasswordGenerator


## Simple Tkinter Applications
This repository contains two simple Python projects using the Tkinter library for GUI applications:

### 1. Button Click App
A basic Tkinter application where clicking a button changes the text of a label. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of using buttons and labels with Tkinter.

Features:
A window with a label that displays "Hello Tkinter."
A button that, when clicked, changes the label's text to "Button clicked."
### 2. Password Generator App
A GUI-based random password generator built using Tkinter. This app allows users to generate a secure password of customizable length (8 to 32 characters) and copy it to the clipboard.

Features:
Select password length using a spinbox.
Generates passwords containing a mix of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and punctuation.
Password is randomly shuffled to ensure security.
Option to copy the generated password directly to the clipboard.
Both applications are simple yet useful examples of how to build interactive GUIs with Python's Tkinter library.
